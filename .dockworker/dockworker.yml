      Katherine MacNaughton’s Masters thesis, The Development of the Theory and Practice of 
      Education in New Brunswick 1784–1900, was expanded into a published version, which was 
      released in 1947 by the University of New Brunswick. The publication was the first and 
      only completed in a projected series of three entitled “University of New Brunswick 
      Historical Studies”, under the editorship and direction of Dr Alfred G. Bailey. An 
      electronic version of the published text was undertaken by Allison Webster and Lisa 
      Charlong at the Electronic Text Centre, University of New Brunswick Libraries, in 1998. 
      By 2010 it was evident that this TEI/SGML version of the document was in need of a 
      significant overhaul, and the website due for redesign. The current electronic version 
      of the text has been issued as part of the University of New Brunswick’s 225th anniversary 
      celebrations in 2010. The project is a result of a partnership between the university’s 
      Archives & Special Collections department, and the Electronic Text Centre at UNB.
